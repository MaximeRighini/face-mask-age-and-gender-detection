# face-mask-age-and-gender-detection

Extracting human attributes, such as gender and age, from biometrics have received much attention in recent years. <br>
Gender and age recognition can provide crucial information for applications such as security, healthcare, and gaming. Deep Learning algorithms used to detect a person's attributes can also be used to tackle other issues such as Covid-19 mask detection. Such detection is very useful in dealing with SARS-COV19 spread. <br>
Current scientific literature has shown that the deep learning approach is able to provide a very fast mask detection algorithm that works in a crowd. It is also possible to use a transfer learning approach to quickly set up a mask detection algorithm. <br>
Our project aims at reproducing and improving this approach, by producing an algorithm capable of performing both mask detection, and age and gender classification.

## Dataset
Both datasets come from kaggle.
